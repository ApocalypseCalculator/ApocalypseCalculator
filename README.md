## Hey there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

My Discord account is `@apocalypsecalculator`. I do software development for fun, and sometimes competitive programming!

### Technologies

JS is my favourite language for web applications. My favourite backend framework is Express and frontend library is React. 

I also have extensive knowledge of C++. Other languages I work with include Java, Go, Python, C, and sometimes Rust.
